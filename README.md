Sole - energy efficiency database
In European Union countries, buildings consume around 40% of the total energy used in total.

But how much does the building in which we live specifically consume? Are most of the energy consumed for heating, for water heating, for using appliances or for cooling?

The energy certification certificate is a valuable tool for evaluating energy consumption, and allows a potential buyer to know the hypothetical energy consumption of a given building.

However it does not say much about real consumption, under real usage conditions.

That's why we designed Hive, a powerful, easy-to-use tool that helps you map, monitor and understand energy consumption in buildings, even in complex cases.

Sole is an open source software that aims to be a first and concrete step in designing a strategy aimed at reducing energy consumption in our buildings.

Sole is particularly suitable for those in charge of building administration, for those working in the energy redevelopment of existing buildings, and for those who are active in the energy-efficient construction sector.
